<p>My name is Christopher Riedel. I am a senior meteorologist at WindBorne Systems. My research focuses on furthering our understanding and prediction of different Earth system components. I investigate these topics using data assimilation and various modeling frameworks, including both physically-based models (Earth system, global atmosphere-only, sea ice, etc.) and AI-based models. I am currently working at WindBorne Systems on projects related to our Global Sounding Balloons (GSBs) and our AI-based weather prediction model called WeatherMesh. GSB-related projects include quality control and evaluation of balloon sensor data to further improve atmospheric sensing. WeatherMesh-related projects include developing AI-based data assimilation with the AI team to incorporate our GSBs along with other observation types to improve forecasts.</p>

<p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-20-0009.1">Published Paper</a></p>
<p>Conventional observations are sparse over the Southern Hemisphere compared to the Northern Hemisphere, leaving forecasting systems to rely on satellite data to fill the gaps. This project focused on developing a forecast system for the Southern Hemisphere using data assimilation and mesoscale numerical weather prediction (NWP), called Antarctic-DART (A-DART). The NWP model was the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS), a polar-modified version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. The Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) software was used for data assimilation, which enabled implementation of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The EnKF provides flow-dependent background error covariance, which has been shown to be important in observation-sparse regions. I developed the forecasting system by coupling DART and AMPS to enable cycled data assimilation. Additionally, I ran multiple experiments evaluating the impacts of different model configurations (e.g., modifying ozone profiles) and assimilating different observation types. An upper-level wind speed bias was identified associated with Meteosat-7 over the Southern Hemisphere. This modeling system was competitive with other operational systems despite only assimilating conventional observations and a limited set of satellite data.</p>

<h3 id="project2"><strong>Project 2: Global Modeling Framework for Arctic-to-Mid-latitude Research Topics</strong></h3>
<a href="https://shareok.org/items/b3d00a63-f6be-44ca-9fe8-4ac471f26a10">Dissertation</a>
<p>As part of my PhD, I developed a global modeling system to investigate the impacts a long-lived Arctic feature, called a tropopause polar vortex (TPV), can have on mid-latitude predictability. This system was designed to address the difficulties that arise when predicting atmospheric features over the Arctic. The Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) global model was chosen due to its non-hydrostatic core and its ability to place higher-resolution grids over the Arctic while relaxing to lower resolution elsewhere through smooth grid transitions. DART was chosen to employ the EnKF, which is important due to the sparsity of observations over the Arctic region. This system, MPAS-DART, was set up to test multiple hypotheses related to the evolution of TPVs in MPAS and how TPVs can impact mid-latitude weather systems. Evaluation of MPAS-DART over the Arctic shows reasonable consistency between the model and observations, though some notable areas require further investigation. The development of MPAS-DART was a collaboration with NCAR, where I worked with the DART team to optimize my data assimilation setup and with MMM scientists to make necessary changes to MPAS (leading to an ASP visit during summer 2018). <strong>All the code changes I made while developing this system have been incorporated by the DART team members in the main git repositories for future use.</strong></p>

<a href="https://shareok.org/items/b3d00a63-f6be-44ca-9fe8-4ac471f26a10">Dissertation</a>
<p>Systematic biases are a common feature of all NWP models used to make forecasts. To further improve forecast accuracy, it is important to physically understand what drives systematic biases once they are identified. However, it can be difficult to pinpoint the physical processes related to identified systematic biases due to the complexity of NWP models. As part of my PhD, I implemented a new method, the mean initial tendency and analysis (MITA), that helps guide users to better understand the physical processes driving a bias. The MITA method was implemented in my MPAS-DART framework that I developed The MITA method draws connections between identified systematic errors and NWP model tendencies. <strong>All the DART and MPAS changes to use the MITA methd have already been incorporated in the main git repositories for users to use in the future.</strong>
<br></p>

</div>
<br>
Using the MITA method, users can leverage model tendencies to better understand the physical processes related to an identified systematic bias or error. In my work, I used a combination of observation diagnostics (Observation minus Background) and analysis increments to identify potential areas for further investigation. Below is an example of an identified systematic bias in both theta and specific humidity using analysis increments (left figure; shown by the persistent non-zero increments over the cycling period). The MITA profiles (center figure) show that the model total tendencies indicate cooling where the analysis increments show warming (disagreement), mainly via the longwave parameterization. Additionally, there is increasing moisture via analysis increments in the same layer. Drawing on physical understanding of moisture and longwave cooling, the increased moisture (shown in the Arctic average specific humidity panel) is leading to excessive model cooling, resulting in the observed bias.
<br><br>
<div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;">

</div>
<br><br><br><br>
The identified moisture bias was tracked down to the initial data used to initialize MPAS-DART (GEFS data was used). There were two issues: 1) RH data from NCEP used to initialize MPAS runs must be passed through an extra processing (WPS) subroutine to adjust RH to saturation with respect to liquid only (this was communicated to NCAR developers), and 2) GEFS RH ensemble mean is high-biased compared to ERA5. With the WPS fix applied, MPAS-initialized specific humidity better matches that of GEFS (Pre-cycling Moisture Initialization Profiles below). Additionally, relaxing the initial moisture profiles in MPAS leads to better agreement with ERA5 and removes the initial moisture bias located at ~100 hPa (Modified Initial Moisture Profiles below). Experiments were run with both fixes to determine their potential impacts on the identified moisture bias above. The WPS fix did not resolve the moisture bias; however, relaxing initial moisture profiles to ERA5 led to better cycling results for moisture when compared to ERA5 (middle panel below). The reduction in the bias associated with moisture initialization leads to less moisture being added through data assimilation, which in turn reduces the amount of cooling via longwave radiation presented above (figure not shown).

<h3 id="project4"><strong>Project 4: The Forecast Impacts of a TPV When Assimilating a Special NAWDEX Dropsonde Dataset</strong></h3>
<a href="https://shareok.org/items/b3d00a63-f6be-44ca-9fe8-4ac471f26a10">Dissertation</a>
<p>A field campaign called the North Atlantic Waveguide and Downstream Impact Experiment (NAWDEX) was performed to explore the impacts of diabatic effects on the jet stream and their impacts on downstream high-impact weather through the use of aircraft (Schäfler et al. 2018). A flight mission during the NAWDEX field campaign was one of the first known targeted observation flights through a TPV (shown below). The dropsonde data (temperature, winds, and moisture) were assimilated in my MPAS-DART framework described above to evaluate the impact of well-positioned observations on: 1) identified biases potentially associated with the TPV (mostly focused on the moisture bias mentioned in Project 3), and 2) TPV representation.
<br><br></p>
<div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;">
  <img src="/images/project4.jpg" alt="Project Image 2" style="width: 75%; min-width: 300px; height: auto; object-fit: contain;">
</div>
<br><br><br><br>
Cross-section analysis composite differences (see below) were calculated for the TPV of interest between two experiments: 1) assimilation with NAWDEX dropsonde data and 2) assimilation without NAWDEX dropsonde data. Potential temperature (theta) comparisons show significant differences in the tropopause fold region, identified by large, positive differences in potential temperature with a narrow area of negative differences just below, where potential temperature values are smaller when NAWDEX dropsondes are assimilated. For water vapor, there is a significant reduction in water vapor just below the tropopause in the core of the TPV extending toward the surface, which increases the gradient of moisture across the tropopause. There is also a significant increase in the normal wind component when NAWDEX observations are assimilated. The increase in the normal wind component could be related to the tropopause fold being pulled back toward the center of the NAWDEX TPV, which is highlighted by the increase in the gradient of potential temperature. Overall, the dropsonde observations have significant impacts on the TPV of interest.

What scale of impacts did I find in the forecasts of the TPV of interest? TPV median forecast track positions for both experiments show that the TPV of interest evolved along similar paths in both experiments testing the dropsonde data. Comparing the minimum potential temperature (intensity) between the two experiments shows a slightly different story. At analysis time, the spread in NAWDEX TPV potential temperatures is smaller and shifted toward lower values for the with-NAWDEX observations assimilated versus without-NAWDEX observations assimilated. As forecast hour increases, potential temperatures for each experiment drift closer together, and by forecast day 1 the values are very similar. The small differences in forecasts are related to the localized nature of the perturbations induced by the NAWDEX dropsondes. Since the perturbations are very localized, the regions surrounding the TPV start to dominate the evolution of forecasted fields, which begins to overpower any impacts of the NAWDEX perturbations.

<h3 id="project5"><strong>Project 5: Interaction Between TPV and Rossby Wave Initiation: A Case Study Analysis</strong></h3>
<a href="https://shareok.org/items/b3d00a63-f6be-44ca-9fe8-4ac471f26a10">Dissertation</a>
<p>A case study investigated the potential connections between a Rossby wave initiation (RWI) event and a nearby TPV. This case study specifically looked into the sensitivities related to different TPV characteristics (intensity, TPV position relative to the jet stream) on the RWI event and how that impacted the downstream development of a surface cyclone (see below). There is a TPV (white circle) that is making its way toward the jet stream (indicated by the tight gradients in 2 PVU potential temperature). Later in time, as the TPV gets closer to the jet stream, an RWI event initiates just downstream of the TPV (gold star). A deep surface cyclone then develops downstream of both the TPV and RWI event.

Ensemble sensitivity analysis (ESA) is used to investigate the connections between the features I listed in the previous sentence. ESA uses linear relationships to describe how changes in a set of state variables (independent – MSLP, 500 mb Z, etc.) change a forecast metric (dependent – rainfall, min MSLP, etc.). The distance of the TPV relative to the jet stream showed that smaller distances resulted in larger 250 hPa heights (left panel below), likely leading to a more enhanced RWI. Additionally, lower MSLP associated with the surface cyclone was a result of stronger wind speeds on the 320K PV surface (middle panel below) and larger poleward moisture transport (right panel below). Overall, there does appear to be a connection between TPVs and RWI events; however, this is just one case study. More studies are required to draw a stronger conclusion.

<strong>Links:</strong> <a href="https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/18/2875/2024/">Published Paper</a>
<p>Sea ice poses a unique challenge for data assimilation because sea ice variables have bounded distributions in both observations and state variables, leading to non-Gaussian distributions. The non-Gaussian nature violates the Gaussian assumptions built into data assimilation algorithms. To gain a better understanding of the effects of the non-Gaussianity, several observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) were run which provided a data assimilation testing framework through experimental observation networks and synthetic observations. The OSSEs were setup using CICE5**, which** is the sea ice component within the Community Earth System Model (CESM), and the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) software for the data assimilation. Synthetic observations are generated from the truth member to produce sea ice concentration (SIC), sea ice thickness (SIT), snow depth (Dsnow), and sea ice surface temperature (SIST) (example of the observing is shown below). The OSSE framework will help determine the best data assimilation configuration for assimilating sea ice and snow observations. <strong>All the DART and icepack changes to these experiments have already been incorporated in the main git repositories for users to use in the future.</strong>

Six different OSSEs were tested with different data assimilation configurations. Findings indicate that assimilating both sea ice thickness and snow depth observations while omitting sea ice concentration observations produced the best sea ice and snow forecasts in our idealized experimental setup (shown below in the EAKF-ThickSnow experiment). The assimilation of SIC doesn't result in poor spatial probability scores**, however,** using the sea ice concentration from the model to compute sea ice area results in a low bias starting in the springtime and extending through summer. To further investigate the poor results obtained when assimilating SIC observations, a simplified data assimilation experiment was set up. This simplified DA experiment mimics SIC during wintertime over the North Pole, meaning that the true SIC does not change over time. The true SIC value is set to 0.99, and its corresponding observation error will vary between 0.1485 (the value if using the same method as the OSSE experiments), 0.07425, and 0.037125**, and** along with two different filters, EAKF and RHF, were tested (see right panel below). For all experiments, the prior ensemble mean drifts away from the true value and moves toward the average observation value over the cycling period. This is because our observation error distribution is a truncated normal distribution, whereas the observation likelihood for EAKF and RHF is assumed to be normal. Applying a non-Gaussian distribution for observation errors while using a Gaussian observation likelihood can lead to erroneous observation impacts, biasing analysis estimates (Pires et al., 2010; Fowler and van Leeuwen, 2013).

<p>Sea ice poses a unique application for testing ensemble Kalman filter algorithms because sea ice observations are nonnegative and doubly bounded, leading to non-Gaussian distributions. A new ensemble filter, the bounded Rank Histogram Filter (RHF), is tested that was developed to better handle non-Gaussian distributions that sea ice has. The bounded RHF alongside the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter, ensemble Kalman filter with perturbed observations, and normal rank histogram filter (RHF) are tested in an OSSE framework like in Project 6. In this project, DART is coupled with a single-column sea ice model called Icepack. This allows for quick testing and is computationally cheap. Consider the example in which the physical variable is a doubly bounded quantity and the four different filter types are used to update (left panel below). Comparing the posterior ensemble members (blue stars), the bounded RHF is the only filter that respects the bounds while reducing the spread of the ensemble members, while the other three filters do not respect the lower bound, which can result in some posterior ensemble members violating the bound. Additionally, a simplified DA experiment, similar to that in Project 6, was performed, and the only filter to pull its prior ensemble towards the truth was the bounded RHF (right panel below). Additionally, the truncated normal likelihood is impactful by pulling the ensemble closer to the truth; however, the bounded RHF prior PDF results in the updated ensemble distribution being bounded below one (e,f in the right panel below). <strong>All the DART and Icepack changes to these experiments have already been incorporated in the main git repositories for users to use in the future.</strong>

Evaluation in the observation space of each filter type helps determine how forecasts are being fitted to assimilated observations. Ensemble mean analysis increments (AIs) are a metric that shows how much the observation is adjusting the background field, and over many cycling times, the desired outcome is for this quantity to approach zero. For SIC AIs, there is a sharp cutoff near zero on the positive side for all the filter types except for the bounded RHF during the refreeze season (left panel below). Since the refreeze season is during wintertime, the low-biased SIC observations during this period resulted in more negative AIs in the three filters that contain Gaussian assumptions. The bounded RHF has a more uniform distribution around zero for SIC AIs, indicating that the filter is weighting the biased SIC observations in a more appropriate way. It's important to investigate how the state space is updated to understand how the observation space updates were passed to the state model variables (right panel below). The experiments using the bounded RHF fit the closest, or were one of the closest, to the truth in all sea ice state fields except sea ice area during the refreeze season.

<h3 id="project8"><strong>Project 8: NERSC GPU Hackathon: Porting DART to work with GPUs</strong></h3>
I was one of three participants from the DART team that took part in the GPU hackathon. The focus area of DART during this hackathon was the portion that has to compute many, many distances between an observation location and grid points. This is part of the localization component in ensemble data assimilation, so as you increase the localization radius for which an observation can impact grid points, you potentially increase the number of distance computations (in theory, not perfectly linear). During the hackathon, we were able to utilize OpenACC, which allowed us to do these distance calculations on a GPU. My role was mainly applying OpenACC to DART and working with our group members from NVIDIA to optimize the compile flags. Doing this, we were able to speed up this portion of the code: <strong>CPU took 7.4s, GPU with default compile flags took 3.4s (118% faster!), and GPU with pinned memory took 1.6s (363% faster!).</strong> The pinned memory compile flag was important as it limited the amount of data transfer between GPU and CPU, leading to a speedup. The DART modifications discussed here have not been applied to DART yet.

<a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/notification/pdf_2025/pns25-23_Comments_GFSv16.4.0.pdf">NWS Public Information Statement About Using New RO Error Model</a><br>
As a NOAA Affiliate (QOSAP/ORTA), my work focused on understanding and improving the usage of Global Navigation Satellite System-Radio Occultation (GNSS-RO) observations within the FV3GFS global workflow. A small portion of that work was testing commercial RO data buys from companies and determining their impacts on forecast performance. Some of that work is captured in the co-author linked paper above. The majority of my work focused on optimizing the assimilation of GNSS-RO observations in the real-time FV3GFS global workflow. This work included testing out new observation error models that are used in the assimilation algorithm within the global workflow. Additionally, I implemented new and updated quality control checks in the assimilation code for GNSS-RO data. Two example diagrams are shown below. The error model that was tested is based on three vertical regions in the atmosphere, broken up by impact height (RO-based height space, left panel below). 1) Fractional LSW: Local Spectral Width (LSW) is a measure of the fluctuations in the RO signal induced by propagation through horizontally inhomogeneous layers or inversion layers (high moisture gradients). Higher LSW means potentially higher uncertainties in the RO observation. 2) 3CHMethod Error: Between 10-30km the error is constant corresponding to a 3-corner hat method to estimate the error. This is similar to what other centers use for RO errors, like ECMWF. 3) STD4060: Compute the standard deviation between the raw observations and an exponential fit (smooths the RO profile; we expect RO data to follow an exp. fit as impact height increases) for impact heights between 40-60km. This value is fed into the new error model. Before this new error model, the error was purely just based on impact height to determine RO error values. Additionally, a new statistical RO QC method was tested that compares ABS(O-B) values to the full 3-corner hat error estimate. If the ABS(O-B) is greater than the 3CH error, the observation is rejected. The nice thing is you can multiply the 3CH error profile by a factor to shift the entire profile or just portions of it (right panel below). All these changes were added to the global workflow code over about a year's time. <strong>The new RO error was implemented into the realtime FV3GFS system for use starting in April 2024. The main code changes are found in setupbend.f90 and genstats_gps.f90. You can find the line indicating it was update looking for this line:<br>

Overall, the impacts were mainly neutral when comparing bending angle (BA) observations to model bending angle values (O-B). The largest difference is occurring in the lower troposphere. This is likely linked to more BAs getting assimilated due to the new statistical QC discussed above. More tuning of this statistical QC is likely needed to determine the sensitivities associated with it. Forecast performance impacts are a bit more apparent, shown by the triangles in the forecast scorecard (right panel below). Quite a few significant differences show up, which are mainly in the tropics and southern hemisphere for RMSE and Bias (upright triangle = significant improvement). Significant improvements were found in the tropics for multiple fields, while there are more mixed results in the southern hemisphere. This was our first attempt at implementing this new approach, so more investigation might be needed to further optimize.

<h3 id="project10"><strong>Project 10: Evaluating and Improving Meteorological Data Collected by WindBorne Balloons </strong></h3>
WindBorne Systems has developed a balloon platform that can collect meteorological data all over the globe, including over sparse regions like the ocean. These systems have been labeled Global Sounding Balloons (GSBs). The GSB is a highly cost-effective platform that can reach data-sparse and -void regions on the globe. GSBs collect in-situ observations from the surface to the stratosphere with their unique real-time, full-range altitude control along with AI-powered autonomous flight control. The GSBs can last 4-40 days, collect observations every 10 seconds, and can target areas of interest using the wind. The data collected needs to be evaluated and quality controlled before sending out to potential customers. In terms of evaluations, I provide monthly evaluation statistics of our balloon data. This balloon data is reviewed to identify any potential issues. If an issue comes up, I work with the balloon and sensor engineers to develop a way to fix the issue. Additionally, I help develop quality control checks that are run in real-time to flag data that might be of lower quality. I have helped to develop and modify several different quality control algorithms since joining WindBorne. Lastly, I work with partner national centers around the globe, like NOAA, ECMWF, and UKMET, to help them incorporate our balloon data into their weather forecasting code to assimilate this data.

<h3 id="project11"><strong>Project 11: Coupling Data Assimilation with the WeatherMesh AI Model at WindBorne </strong></h3>
WindBorne Systems has joined this AI revolution with WeatherMesh (WM), a transformer-based AI weather model that ranks among the most skillful AI weather models in the current landscape (<a href="https://windbornesystems.com/blog/weathermesh-4-technical-blog">WM Blog Post</a>). Combining both WM and the GSBs discussed above provides a very unique forecasting tool to make forecast decisions with. In my role at WindBorne, I have worked with team members on three different approaches to investigate how to combine our GSB data with WM. Approaches 1 and 2 used traditional data assimilation (DA) methods, for which I took the main investigative role. Approach 3 uses AI as the data assimilation component, where I have a more collaborative role.
<p><strong>Aproach 1:</strong>
<a href="https://ams.confex.com/ams/105ANNUAL/meetingapp.cgi/Session/69898">Link to 2025 AMS Presentation</a>
Since this was the first attempt, cold-start (non-cycling) DA tests were run to see the impacts of assimilating only GSB data into WM would provide. Cold-start here means we start with an ensemble analysis from ECMWF IFS and assimilate GSB information into it. The DA software used was DART from NCAR. These experiments quickly showed there would be some unique challenges using traditional DA with AI models. First, ensembles driven by AI models lead to forecast spread that is under-dispersive (left panel below). In our case, we found that just passing IFS ensemble member data through our latent space encoder and then decoding this information back out to physical space led to a reduction in ensemble spread (right panel below). The forecast spread deficiency will lead to traditional DA techniques under-weighting the observation information due to the statistical methods used in the DA algorithms when updating. Additionally, there was some &ldquo;noisy&rdquo; structure in the analysis increment updates. This is likely linked back to AI fields having noise and physical inconsistencies in their forecasts, meaning AI models do not have to respect physical constraints like geostrophic balance.</p>

</div>
<br>
<strong>Aproach 2:</strong>
I took an approach to further understand the potential of assimilating GSBs into WM by using an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE). This OSSE would use ERA5 as the truth data and create balloon profiles over the globe (~8,000 locations). Again, the DA software used is DART. Since this is an OSSE, I will also get to test out using WM in a fully-cycling system, which is difficult in Approach 1 above. Cycling here means 6-hour forecasts produced by WM will be used during the assimilation step. This ensemble had 50 members and assimilated ~700,000 observations for temperature, winds, and moisture at different pressure levels. Early on in the cycling experiment, the results looked promising with decreases in RMSE (which remained stable early) and an increase in the number of observations that were assimilated (left panel below). However, as the cycling period increases, you start to see a decrease in the number of observations assimilated and a bias drift away from zero. Additionally, mean and maximum values in prior inflation are starting to increase with cycling times, indicating that the ensemble spread is too small compared to how different the ensemble mean is from observation values (right panel below). In fact, prior inflation values near 100 would usually lead to physical models becoming numerically unstable. So the theory is the early cycling times worked out because the individual WM ensemble members are quite accurate out to 6-7 days, so large updates were not needed then. However, the WM ensemble spread continually decreased as the cycling time increased (remember the encoder-decoder spread issue discussed above), so when large differences between WM and observations appeared, the spread was too small, leading to increased prior inflation. Ultimately, this ensemble would fail and become unstable or just have really poor forecast skill.

<strong>Aproach 3:</strong> 
Due to the difficulties found in Approaches 1 and 2, it was decided that the best approach would be to make an all-in-one AI forecasting system that would perform the DA update and make forecasts. I have worked alongside the AI team to collaborate on this effort. In many ways, AI uses similar approaches to DA, especially the variational techniques like 3DVAR and 4DVAR. This AI DA system is built around the WM framework that has already been established as very skillful. The method follows the encoder-decoder framework applied to the different observation types and is based on different transformer elements like cross-attention and self-attention. <strong>This is still a very active area of research at WindBorne!</strong> <a href="https://windbornesystems.com/blog/windborne-ai-da">Blog Post</a>
<h3 id="project12"><strong>Project 12: Learning AI and Neural Networks Through Basketball Predictions</strong></h3>
I decided to use basketball predictions as a method to further learn how to develop and run AI models. My particular focus has been on neural networks, but I have developed multivariate regression, random forests, and Gradient Boosting models. Basketball predictions are used because I have a particular interest in basketball and the related datasets are relatively small (quicker training and fewer computational resources). I have developed several different AI models to predict game winners and scores. All my code is written using PyTorch and my code has been run on both Mac GPUs and Nvidia GPUs. I have played around with different AI neural network architectures, which include Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and Attention-Based methods. Additionally, I have tested out different loss functions for different model prediction configurations, which include MSE (deterministic predictions) and almost-fair CRPS (ensemble predictions). Below is the current model that I am developing and training for this upcoming season. Simple afCRPS was a simple MLP model that was used as a baseline for working with ensemble predictions. The Center+Variance model (diagram below on the left) allows the model to learn the amount of random uncertainty needed to satisfy the spread/skill relationship (optimal is equal to 1).
